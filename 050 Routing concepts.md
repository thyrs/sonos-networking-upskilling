### Routers Segment Broadcast Domains
Here’s the blunt truth: broadcasts are noisy and dumb, and if you let them run wild, they’ll wreck network performance. Switches happily flood broadcasts out every port like they don’t care — because they don’t. Routers, on the other hand, actually do their job. **They stop broadcasts cold**. Every router interface creates a **separate broadcast domain**, and broadcasts stay trapped inside it.

* Switches propagate broadcasts out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received. 
* The only device that stops broadcasts is a __router__.
* Routers __do not__ propagate broadcasts. 
* Each router interface connects to a broadcast domain and broadcasts are only propagated within that specific broadcast domain.


* A problem with a large broadcast domain is that these hosts can generate excessive broadcasts and negatively affect the network.
* The solution is to reduce the size of the network to create smaller broadcast domains in a process called subnetting. 
* Dividing the network address 172.16.0.0 /16 into two subnets of 200 users each: 172.16.0.0 /24 and 172.16.1.0 / 24. 
* Broadcasts are only propagated within the smaller broadcast domains when using subnetting.
